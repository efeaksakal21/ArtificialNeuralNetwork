 MATLAB Artificial Neural Network from Scratch

This project is a fully custom implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built from scratch using MATLAB.  
It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of neural networks, including:

- Forward propagation  
- Backpropagation  
- Weight and bias updates  
- Gradient descent optimization  
- Activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLU, etc.)  
- Training on sample datasets  

Features
- No built-in neural network libraries used  
- Clean and educational implementation  
- Modular MATLAB function structure  
- Easy to modify and extend
